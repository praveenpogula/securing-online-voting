SECURE ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM USING BLOCK CHAIN

The evolution of democratic systems has emphasized the critical importance of secure and fair elections, a practice deeply rooted in history since ancient Greece. Traditional voting methods, typically requiring physical presence at a polling station, face challenges such as tampering and security vulnerabilities. To address these issues, we propose a secure online voting system based on Blockchain technology, incorporating homomorphic encryption and hashing techniques to ensure the integrity and privacy of each vote. The system employs smart contracts, which activate when an election is scheduled, ensuring an efficient, tamper-resistant voting process. With an ever-growing voter base, modernizing voting infrastructure to enhance security and maintain fairness has become essential. Our approach decentralizes e-voting platform management across blockchains, leveraging a multi-winner approval voting system called Aqua on the Ethereum blockchain. This solution was rigorously tested and compared on public and private blockchains, demonstrating reliable performance at a relatively low speed while ensuring complete data privacy through homomorphic encryption.
